About
-----
This is a small project of Arduino Leonardo (PRO-micor) Joystick.
Project is based on:

32-FUNCTION-BUTTON-BOX

https://github.com/AM-STUDIO/32-FUNCTION-BUTTON-BOX#32-function-button-box
 
The main laout and purpose is for Kerbal Space Program game. 

Modification
------------

1. I get rid of 3 rotaries, to give space for 4-asix.
2. Matrix for buttons is extended to 6x6 (yes... posbility of 36 buttons)
3. Four of those buttons are used for HAT-switch capability

So I end up with... 34 button, 4 axis and HAT switck JOYSTICK :)
